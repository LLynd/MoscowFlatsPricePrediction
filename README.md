# MoscowFlatsPricePrediction

https://www.kaggle.com/c/master-class-property

This is my (updated) solution for the kaggle competition, organised as a part of DataWorkshop.eu Data Science Master Class course.

This was the first Kaggle competition I've ever participated in - I took the 23rd place (out of 100), using a first version of my solution (based on the code provided by the course). This repository contains my updated solution, which has improved accuracy (based on the available dataset, not the one used in the competition) in comparison to the first version. The metric used for scoring is mean absolute error.

The dataset provided by this course contains information (unfortunately labeled in russian) about a number of flats available for sale in Moscow. My program aims to predict prices of those flats.
